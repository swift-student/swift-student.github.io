At Turo, I am part of a cross-functional product team working to bring exciting new features to our users. I love translating product designs and requirements into thoughtfully crafted and well-tested code that ultimately delivers a seamless user experience. I also take every opportunity I can to improve the developer experience for my peers by creating shared components, contributing to modularization, and improving our CI infrastructure.

**Highlights**:
- Architected and implemented key features that both improved the host and guest experience and drove key business metrics
- Developed unit testing strategies and tools, including [TestDRS](https://github.com/open-turo/swift-test-drs), an open source mocking library that enhances test reliability and simplifies complex dependency mocking
- Created reusable components for design consistency and accelerated feature development
