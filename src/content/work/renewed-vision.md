At Renewed Vision, I worked on ProPresenter, a powerful and complex desktop multimedia presentation application. Working on a large codebase that had been developed over more than a decade, I quickly honed my debugging skills by resolving numerous bugs and crashes. I also contributed many performance improvements, including optimizations to text rendering and app launch time. A little over a year after joining, I received a promotion and stepped into a team lead role, guiding a team of Windows, macOS, and systems developers to deliver new features.

**Highlights**:
- Designed and developed a custom slider control used throughout the app
- Contributed to the technical design and development of a public API to control ProPresenter
- Lead the development of a Stream Deck plugin to interface with ProPresenter through the API
