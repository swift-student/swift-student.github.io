title: About me

Hey, my name is Shawn Gee, and if you didn't guess by the name of this site, I am currently studying to be a an iOS developer and loving every minute of learning the Swift language. I built this site in order to share what I'm learning, both to help cement it in my brain, as well as hopefully help others learn a thing or two with Swift. 

### My history

My interest in programming started when I was a little kid and my uncle, who was in to technology, gave me a book about Java. I remember reading through it and though I had no idea how to set up an environment to actually build something with Java, I was simply fascinated by the concept of object oriented programming that it described in the opening chapter. My young mind was always trying to invent, and this opened my eyes to a way to create things, give them properties, and allow them to perform functions in a virtual world!

It was a long time, however, before I actually got my first taste of programming. In 5th grade I learned HTML, though that wasn't the same as the Java I had read about. Throughout middle and high school, I worked on websites, built and repaired computers, learned graphic design, motion graphics, video editing, and much more. But I still hadn't learned to program.

After high school, I intended on going to to college for graphic design, but ended up working with my parents business as a woodworker. I dabbled in coding a couple times, but never picked it up for very long. Sometimes I regret not sticking with it, but I'm old enough to know that sometimes things just workout the way they do for a reason.

I found that reason three years ago when I met my lovely wife, Genna. I really couldn't ask for a better, more supporting wife. Now that she has graduated with a degree in Respiratory Therapy, and is currently working on getting a job, we have decided that I will soon take a break from woodworking to pursue a career in iOS development. I am so excited at what the future holds for us, my career, and this website.
